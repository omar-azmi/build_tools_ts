/** A variable-sized buffer of bytes with `read()` and `write()` methods.
 *
 * Buffer is almost always used with some I/O like files and sockets. It allows
 * one to buffer up a download from a socket. Buffer grows and shrinks as
 * necessary.
 *
 * Buffer is NOT the same thing as Node's Buffer. Node's Buffer was created in
 * 2009 before JavaScript had the concept of ArrayBuffers. It's simply a
 * non-standard ArrayBuffer.
 *
 * ArrayBuffer is a fixed memory allocation. Buffer is implemented on top of
 * ArrayBuffer.
 *
 * Based on {@link https://golang.org/pkg/bytes/#Buffer | Go Buffer}.
