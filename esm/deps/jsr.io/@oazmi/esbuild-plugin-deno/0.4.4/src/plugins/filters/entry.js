/** this filter plugin intercepts all entities and makes them sequentially pass through three resolvers,
 * so that an absolute path to the resource can be acquired in the best possible way (citation needed).
 *
 * > [!important]
 * > you **must** include the {@link resolverPlugin} somewhere in your esbuild build-options,
 * > otherwise this plugin will not be able to resolve to absolute paths on its own,
 * > and all efforts of this plugin will pretty much be for naught.
 *
 * ## details
 *
 * an explanation of the operations performed by each of the three resolvers follows:
 *
 * ### 1. initial plugin-data injector
 *
 * this resolver simply inserts the user's {@link EntryPluginSetupConfig.initialPluginData} to **all** entry-points which lack an `args.pluginData`.
 * but when {@link EntryPluginSetupConfig.forceInitialPluginData} is `true`, the entry-points with existing pluginData will be overwritten.
 *
 * it is through this resolver that things like {@link CommonPluginData.importMap | import-maps}
 * and the {@link CommonPluginData.runtimePackage | deno-package-resolver} get inserted into the entry-point resources,
 * and then seeded into their dependencies.
 *
 * ### 2. plugin-data inheritor
 *
 * a fundamental problem (design choice?) with esbuild is that resource's `pluginData` **does not** propagate to the child-dependencies,
 * when esbuild's native resolvers and loaders process the resource.
 * this problem of stripping away valuable `pluginData` can also occur in external plugins that are not designed mindfully.
 *
 * as a consequence, we would not be able to embed import-maps and runtime-package-resolvers that can be picked up by dependencies.
 *
 * thus, to counteract this issue, this resolver inspects the `pluginData` of every resolved entity, stores it in a dictionary for book-keeping,
 * and then, when a dependency-resource comes along with its plugin-data stripped away (i.e. `args.pluginData === undefined`),
 * this resolver inserts its dependent's (`args.importer`) plugin-data.
 * in effect, this resolver permits inheritance of plugin-data when it is stripped away.
 *
 * ### 3. absolute-path resolution
 *
 * finally, we come to the resolver which implicitly calls the namespaced resolvers of the {@link resolverPlugin},
 * which is a pipeline that can resolve {@link CommonPluginData.importMap | import-maps},
 * {@link CommonPluginData.runtimePackage | deno-packages},
 * {@link nodeModulesResolverFactory | node-packages (`node_modules`)},
 * and perform generic path-joining, in order to get the absolute path (doesn't have to be filesystem path) to the resource.
 *
 * most resolvers of the {@link resolverPlugin} require {@link CommonPluginData | `pluginData`} to be useful.
 * which is why we have to ensure its availability and inheritance through the two prior resolvers,
 * in order for the {@link resolverPlugin} to be effective.
 *
 * ---
 *
 * > [!tip]
 * > while the placement order of the {@link resolverPlugin} does not matter (invariant behavior),
 * > placing it at the front would reduce the number of redundant `onResolve` callbacks received by this plugin,
 * > which then need to be bounced-back to prevent an indefinite `onResolve` recursion.
 * >
 * > you may wonder how this plugin does not spiral into an endless recursion of `onResolve` callbacks,
 * > when it uses the "capture-all" filter that spans throughout all namespaces, meanwhile using `build.resove()`.
 * >
 * > that's because upon the interception of a new entity, we insert a unique `symbol` marker into the `pluginData`,
 * > which when detected again, halts the plugin from processing it further (by returning `undefined`).
 * >
 * > moreover, this plugin validates that the `args.namespace` it receives must be one of `[undefined, "", "file"]`
 * > (see {@link defaultEsbuildNamespaces}), otherwise it will terminate processing it any further.
 * > this check is put in place to prevent this plugin from treading into the territory of other plugins' namespaces,
 * > which would potentially ruin their logic and `pluginData`.
