/** a factory function that returns a general purpose url content loading function for your esbuild plugin, tuned to your specific `config`.
 *
 * for the content to be correctly fetched and loaded, your `args.path` **must** be in one of the following formats:
 * - an `"http://"` or an `"https://"` url
 * - a `"file://"` url
 * - or, an absolute local file path (such as `"/home/bin/..."` or `"C:/Users/..."`)
 *
 * make sure that the path is **not** a relative path (even if it's relative to the current working directory).
 *
 * > [!important]
 * > esbuild identifies redundant/duplicate resources by their _resolved path_ and _namespace_ .
 * > if the same resource is being bundled but with either a different resolved path, or under a different namespace,
 * > then esbuild will consider them to be separate resources, instead of being one and the same.
 * > thus, it is extremely crucial that you prepare a uniquely-idenfifiable resolved path in the plugin's resolver,
 * > rather than delaying its resolution in the plugin's loader.
 * >
 * > in other words, for best results minifiable results, you should resolve the following things in the plugin's resolver, rather than the plugin's loader:
 * > - a path that is an alias inside the current import map, should be resolved to absolute an path (i.e. preferebly an `http://` or `file://` path)
 * > - jsr and npm specifiers (such as `jsr:@scope/package/pathname`) should also be resolved to http paths.
 * > - if you are caching jsr/npm/http resources on your local filesystem, you should _still_ resolve the resources by their absolute http paths,
 * >   and then check for the cached resource's existence in the filesystem inside the plugin's loader function.
 * >   do not _resolve_ to a local filesystem path if cached resources are detected, since it will break equivalency of referenced resource's resolved path.
 * >
 * > typically, the unique key that esbuild uses for identifiying redundant/duplicate resource references is of the following template:
 * > `${resolver_result.namespace}:${resolver_result.path}`
 * >
 * > where `resolver_result` is of kind {@link OnResolveResult | `esbuild.OnResolveResult`}.
 * >
 * > this key also becomes the key of the resource in the output metadata object (if it is enabled).
 *
 * > [!caution]
 * > based on some logging tests, I've verified that esbuild does indeed memorize the result of an `onLoad`'s callback.
 * > this means that it is possible for inconsistencies to occur in your `pluginData`, when the dependency paths are being resolved.
 * > but I will say that it is hard to imagine if this could ever become an issue, since the dependencies will also be loaded _only once_ .
 * > although, the next time something other than the original dependant, requires the same dependency file,
 * > the new `pluginData` (i.e. potentially different) of the new dependant will not be conveyed to the loader (since its results are cached by esbuild).
 *
 * @param config provide a configuration to customize some aspects of the returned loader function.
 * @returns a url loader function that can be passed to the callback of {@link EsbuildPluginBuild.onLoad | `esbuild.PluginBuild.onLoad`},
 *   so that it can fetch the contents of url-based paths when esbuild intercept

 *   since it will lead to some redundant ping-pongging (but the final resolved result will remain unchanged).
