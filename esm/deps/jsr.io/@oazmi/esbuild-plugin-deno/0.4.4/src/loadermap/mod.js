/** utility submodule for identifying an http response's mime type ("content-type" header), and mapping it to an esbuild loader.
 *
 * TODO: currently, the mime and extension to esbuild loader mapping is immutable.
 *   the end user might benefit more if they could directly modify it,
 *   instead of only being able to modify it via `mimeTypeLoaderMap` and `extensionTypeLoaderMap`.
 *   but on the other hand, making them immutable would mean that we will not be able to use a an `InvertibleMap` class,
 *   and instead have to always generate the inverse map on every call to `guessMimeLoaders`, which is highly inefficient.
 *   or alternatively, we might have to store the data in an inverted map in the first place to prevent the need for inverting.
 *   but that will make its representation quite ugly.
